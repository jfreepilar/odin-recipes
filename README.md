The Odin Recipe

The goal of this project is to create a basic recipe website, applying the knowledge acquired from previous lessons, including HTML and CSS basics. The website comprises a main index page with links to a few recipes.

Landing Page

The landing page features a neat and minimalist design, including a header, a logo, and a background image. I would like to acknowledge Pexels.com for the background image.

Recipe Page Content

Therecipe pages include images, descriptions, ingredients (followed by an unordered list of the needed ingredients), and steps (followed by an ordered list of the necessary procedures for making the dish). I would like to acknowledge to Allrecipes.com for providing all the recipes used in this project.

Thank you for exploring this recipe website project with me. I hope you find the recipes enjoyable and the website design appealing. If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to share them. Happy cooking!
